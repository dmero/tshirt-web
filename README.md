# T-Shirt Shop 🛍️

Modern Django e-commerce platform for browsing t-shirts, managing cart, and secure checkout with **Stripe payment processing**. Full-featured with automated email notifications, order tracking, refund management, and professional admin interface.

## Run the local preview on Windows

From this project folder in Command Prompt, run:

```bat
run-preview.cmd
```

In PowerShell, use `./run-preview.cmd`. The launcher uses the project's `.venv`
Python even if a different Conda environment (such as `tshirt`) is activated.
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser. If port 8000 is already in use,
run `run-preview.cmd 127.0.0.1:8001` and open port 8001 instead.

Equivalent command:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver --settings=tshirt_shop.preview_settings
```

The preview uses SQLite and disables payments and outgoing emails. The plain
`python manage.py runserver` command uses whichever Python environment is active
and the normal settings, which retain the existing MySQL configuration unless
`DATABASE_URL` is set. These are different setups.

For a fresh checkout, create `.venv` with `python -m venv .venv`, then install
dependencies with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Run migrations with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate --settings=tshirt_shop.preview_settings`.
See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for production setup.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # create this from your current environment if missing
```

> **Note:** If `requirements.txt` is not yet generated, create one with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` once dependencies are installed.

### 2. Configure environment variables

Sensitive settings (database credentials, SMTP, etc.) are loaded from `.env`. Copy the template and fill in real values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env to set MySQL and SMTP credentials
```

Required keys:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Stripe publishable key (pk_test_* for testing) |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key (sk_test_* for testing) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook signing secret (optional) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | From address for emails (e.g., Gmail account) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | SMTP/app password |
| `EMAIL_HOST`/`EMAIL_PORT` | SMTP host/port (defaults to Gmail TLS) |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | Sender shown in emails |
| `EMAIL_USE_TLS` / `EMAIL_USE_SSL` | Toggle TLS/SSL (TLS default) |

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file! It contains sensitive API keys and passwords.

### 3. Database setup

Create the MySQL database and user referenced in `settings.py`, then run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Optionally seed demo data:

```bash
python manage.py createsampledata
```

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to browse the storefront. Admin UI is available at `/admin/`.
